# CPU_Scheduling
This repository contains a detailed analysis of CPU scheduling algorithms, including First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), Round Robin (RR), and Priority Scheduling. 
The report covers theoretical concepts, algorithm implementation, performance evaluation, and comparisons based on
turnaround time, waiting time, and CPU utilization.
