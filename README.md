# CPU_Scheduling

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and implementation of various **CPU scheduling algorithms**, designed to illustrate how modern operating systems manage process execution. It focuses on evaluating and comparing the efficiency of the following classic scheduling strategies:

- **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
- **Shortest Job Next (SJN)** (also known as Shortest Job First - SJF)
- **Round Robin (RR)**
- **Priority Scheduling**

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

CPU scheduling is a fundamental component of operating system design, responsible for determining which process in the ready queue is to be allocated the CPU next. This project delves into:

- **Theoretical concepts** behind each scheduling algorithm.
- **Implementation** of the algorithms using a programming language (e.g., Java).
- **Performance evaluation** metrics such as:
  - Average Waiting Time
  - Average Turnaround Time
  - CPU Utilization
- **Tabular structure* and discussion on the suitability of each algorithm in different scenarios.


ðŸ“Š Performance Metrics
Each algorithm is analyzed based on:

Average Waiting Time (AWT)

Average Turnaround Time (ATT)


Results are compared to understand which scheduling method performs best under varying workloads.

Algorithm descriptions with pseudocode

Step-by-step walkthroughs of example scenarios

Comparison tables

Conclusion and recommendations

ðŸ§  Use Cases
This project is ideal for:

Operating Systems coursework
